INSERT INTO "swn_alienstructure" VALUES (1, 'Democratic', 'The species has a broadly democratic organization, with individual members having a formal say in the choice of leadership. This voting need not necessarily be based on numbers; it might be a vote with money, military power, religious influence, possession of certain biological traits, or any other metric that makes sense to the aliens. Whatever the specific currency, politics for this race tends to revolve around persuasion and diplomacy rather than use of military force to determine species-wide policies.');
INSERT INTO "swn_alienstructure" VALUES (2, 'Monarchic', 'The species is ruled by a single being, with such rule justified by custom, biological imperative, divine mandate, personal influence, or familial ties. Such monarchic societies almost invariably have a "noble" caste of some kind to act as administrators and officials for the monarch, and they usually make up the pool from which new monarchs are chosen. The specific title for a monarch will usually depend on the justification for their rule- Chieftain, Emperor, Broodmother, High Priest, Dictator, Chief Elder, or so forth.');
INSERT INTO "swn_alienstructure" VALUES (3, 'Tribal', 'The species is organized into multiple tribes based on lineage, philosophy, or geographical location. Tribes set their own laws and policies, and are prone to intense internal struggles over resources and status. There may exist a "paramount tribe" that inflicts its will upon the others through brute strength or traditional esteem. Tribal leaders tend to be personally distinguished, and usually have earned their position through personal accomplishments and the broad support of their tribemates.');

Individual oligarchs might have their own goals, but no single member has the strength to enforce its will upon the whole. These oligarchs might be the product of hereditary inheritance, or individual members of the species might one day aspire to join their numbers.');
