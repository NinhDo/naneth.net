INSERT INTO "swn_alienbodytype" VALUES (1, 'Humanlike', 'Humanlike aliens are just that; extremely close to humans in outward appearance. They might have unusual skin or hair coloration, different hair growth distributions, an odd number of fingers, cranial ridges, a novel skin texture, variant ear shapes, or different average body builds or sizes, but they largely appear like humans. Xenobiologists postulate that the human shape is simply a very successful evolutionary route on Earth-like planets, and other worlds with similar conditions are likely to produce similar sapients. Crank scientists tend to favor theories of pan-galactic Creators that spread humanlike shapes throughout space; these theories conspicuously fail to take into account the dramatically different DNA and internal organ makeup of many humanlike aliens.');
INSERT INTO "swn_alienbodytype" VALUES (2, 'Avian', 'Avian aliens favor birdlike features. Feathered tails, wings, beaks, drastic coloring differences between males and females, skin either partially or fully covered in feathers, hollow bones, and clawed feet and hands are all traits that might be present in an avian-flavored alien. Such avians might have remarkably good vision or show unusual talent as pilots thanks to an evolutionary predilection for thinking in three dimensions.');
INSERT INTO "swn_alienbodytype" VALUES (3, 'Reptilian', 'Reptilian aliens can range from the classic "lizard man" look to a more subtle combination of pebble-scaled skin, membrane frills, broad bodies, cold-bloodedness, nictitating membranes, an exceptional sense of smell, thick claws, powerful builds, sharp teeth, and fine scales. Bodies may be broad and thick like that of a lizard, or perhaps sinuous like that of a snake. Reptilian aliens might be found especially on damp, watery worlds, and might be outright amphibious over all or part of their life spans.');
INSERT INTO "swn_alienbodytype" VALUES (4, 'Insectile', 'Insectile aliens are usually possessed of chitinous "skin" and one or more pairs of compound eyes. Membranous wings aren’t unknown, but are probably vestigial and useless on all but the smallest or lightest aliens. Insectile aliens might have sucking mouthparts if their primary food source is plant sap- or blood- or might use chewing mandibles instead for a more solid diet. Insectile aliens that function as a hive collective are something of a classic trope, but there’s no reason that a species can’t instead take after more solitary hunting insects such as beetles or spiders.');
INSERT INTO "swn_alienbodytype" VALUES (5, 'Exotic', 'Exotic aliens are built out of parts and materials that aren''t normally found in Terran life forms. A humanoid might be composed out of a kind of organic plastic that makes up much of their home planet''s biochemistry, or be composed of an intricate array of interlocking crystals and woody organic elements. You should pick one or more materials that aren''t normally part of an animal''s body and have them play a major role in the alien''s biology. As a consequence, this kind of alien is probably highly dependent upon their home world for food and other biological necessities. If not, they likely spend a lot of effort synthesizing vital materials out of local supplies.');
INSERT INTO "swn_alienbodytype" VALUES (6, 'Hybrid', 'Hybrid aliens combine aspects of two or more of the types described here. You should roll two or three times and then pick a few traits from each type to mix together. You might want to take the first type rolled as the dominant flavor of the alien''s biology and then color the other components accordingly.');
